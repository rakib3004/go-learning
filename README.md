# Software Maintenance Course Version Control File Changes Analysis
My version control file changes analysis is based on * Go Programming Language *

## Task 1: 
You are given a source code file of a specific programming language. You have to calculate the SLOC (only source line of code without comment) of that file.
##
Task 2: 
You will be given two versions of a source code file. You have to identify the number of changes (addition, deletion, total changes) between these two files.
## Task 3: 
You will be given two versions of the source code repository (two folders that contain source code at two different versions). You have to identify which files have been changed and calculate the number of changes (addition, deletion, total changes).
